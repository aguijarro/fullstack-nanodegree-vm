-----------

This project, is about a Python module that uses the PostgreSQL database to keep track of players and matches in a game tournament.

The game tournament will use the Swiss system for pairing up players in each round: players are not eliminated, and each player should be paired with another player with the same number of wins, or as close as possible.

It contains three modules one for data (tournament.sql), other for business logig( tournament.py) and the last one for test (tournament_test.py).
